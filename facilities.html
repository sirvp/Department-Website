        <h3>Centre for High Performance Computing</h3>
        <p id="p1">The centre for high Performance Computing assures significant contribution as per the changing needs of researchers and industrialists. The system offers value added services in the field of variety and large data processing like Bioinformatics, Oceanography, Nanotechnology, Image Rendering, etc, which demands powerful and   complex computation. The High Performance Cluster Computing System, `Dakshina Cluster Series-1 & 2 in the centre, is developed with 40 nodes and two IBM servers exclusively for the study of parallel searching on Cluster Computing System. The system built using free software, is based on Beowulf Architecture. Free software group of FISAT provides open source codes for the development of HPC.  The CHPC often conducts popularization programs in the field of science and technology. It offers industry and research projects for interested students.  The continuous hard work and dedication of students faculty members of FISAT helped in making this centre a reality</p>
